# Ethereum Smart Wallet
An Ethereum smart contract wallet that allows users to securely deposit, hold, and transfer ETH with programmable logic.

# Overview
The Ethereum Smart Wallet project demonstrates the implementation of a basic smart contract wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to:
  * Deposit and hold Ether (ETH) in the smart contract
  * Transfer ETH from the smart contract to other Ethereum addresses
  * Implement custom logic and rules around transactions using Solidity like conditional transactions

# Features
  * Non-custodial: Users maintain full control over their funds and private keys
  * Programmable: The wallet's behavior can be customized using Solidity smart contract code
  * Recoverable: Users can set up recovery options in case they lose access to their wallet
  * Secure: Smart contract wallets provide a more secure alternative to externally owned accounts (EOAs) by eliminating the need for private keys

# Usage
  1) Connect your Ethereum wallet to the dApp.
  2) Deposit ETH into the smart contract wallet.
  3) Transfer ETH from the smart contract to other Ethereum addresses.
  4) Customize the smart contract logic as needed.
